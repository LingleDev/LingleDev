Heyo! I see you've discovered my profile. :eyes:

# About Me
I'm a rocker by nature. I like bands like Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park, Three Days Grace, Five Finger Death Punch, etc. Check out my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/9zqbd3u89wsns30n8crhgb3se).  
I've been programming in JavaScript since I was 12. It's my passion, and I plan to make a career from it. 
I'm also [certified](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxDL-lONBT2kEuhwBOVFGdAXyRyQVg_O/view?usp=sharing) in Adobe Photoshop CC 2018! I got this certification at 16 years old, and I am quite proficient in both [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) & [GIMP](https://gimp.org).
